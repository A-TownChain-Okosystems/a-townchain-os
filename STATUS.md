# Repository Status — a-townchain-os

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Repository | a-townchain-os |
| Version | 0.1.0 |
| Status | development |

| Language boundary | Rust native infrastructure; ATCLang on-chain semantics; ATC-VM execution boundary |
| Build | NOT VERIFIED — current CI evidence required |
| Tests | 106/106 was recorded for GATE-KAI-001 Iteration 2; a fresh CI run is required for release evidence |
| Documentation | ATC-STD-README-001 / ATC-STD-MD-001 |

## Current cross-check

The repository was re-checked against the current organization architecture and implementation state on 2026-09-15.

The former Issue #112 code-side work areas are present in the current tree:

- G2-A: deterministic Model Registry and SHA-256-verified model cache;
- G2-B: persistent state with WAL-before-state ordering, hash-chain validation and crash recovery;
- G2-C: real TCP transport, bounded framing/backpressure and churn/reconnect coverage;
- G2-D: versioned protocol envelopes and deterministic snapshot-return rollback semantics.

GATE-KAI-001 Review Iteration 2 records 106/106 tests green and the code-side closure of these areas. This is historical release evidence, not a substitute for a fresh CI run on the current commit.

## Remaining production gates

`PRODUCTION_READY` remains deliberately blocked until all of the following are evidenced:

1. a fresh current-commit CI/build/test run is green;
2. the external security audit described by the GATE-KAI-001 security checklist is completed and findings are dispositioned;
3. the current production network configuration, TLS/DoS hardening and multi-node operational evidence are independently verified;
4. release approval is recorded by the owner.

No production claim is inferred from documentation alone.

## Architecture consistency

The repository remains the L7 integration/runtime layer. It must not absorb ShivaCore kernel responsibilities, and it must not move blockchain consensus semantics into the OS runtime. AD-008 remains the language boundary: ATCLang is canonical for on-chain semantics, Rust carries native infrastructure, and ATC-VM is the execution boundary.

## Evidence policy

No PASS state is inferred from documentation alone. Current build, test, security and production claims require machine-readable evidence from the relevant current commit/CI run. Hardware readiness additionally requires hardware-backed evidence.
